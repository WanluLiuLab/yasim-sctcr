# Glossary

- **T-Cell Receptor (TCR)**

  The T-Cell Receptor (TCR) is a protein complex found on the surface of T cells, which is responsible for recognizing fragments of antigens (peptides) presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells.

- **Single-Cell TCR Sequencing (scTCR-Seq)**

  Single-Cell TCR Sequencing (scTCR-Seq) is a technique used to analyze the TCR repertoire at the single-cell level. It allows researchers to determine the sequences of TCRs expressed by individual T cells.

- **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)**

  Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), also known as high-throughput sequencing, is a modern sequencing technology that allows for the rapid sequencing of large amounts of DNA or RNA. Unlike traditional Sanger sequencing, which sequences one DNA fragment at a time, NGS can sequence millions of DNA fragments simultaneously.

- **Protein-Coding Genes(PCG)**

  Protein-coding genes (PCG) are segments of DNA that contain the instructions for making proteins.

- **FASTA**

  FASTA is a text-based file format used for representing either nucleotide sequences or amino acid (protein) sequences. A FASTA file typically contains one or more sequences, each preceded by a single-line description (header) that starts with the greater-than symbol (`>`) followed by a unique identifier for the sequence.

- **Tab-Separated Value (TSV)**

  Tab-Separated Value (TSV) is a file format. In a TSV file, each line corresponds to a row in the table, and each value within a line is separated by a tab character.
