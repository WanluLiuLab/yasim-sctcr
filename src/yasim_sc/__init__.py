yasim_sc -- Yet Another Single Cell RNA-Seq SIMulator

This is a simulator designed to simulate scRNA-Seq data.
However, what it can only do now is to generate barcodes,
and make LLRGs work in parallel.
It cannot simulate 10x Genomics data.

It is recommended for users to provide their own count matrix.
